                                          Threat level indicates <b>how strong</b> the enemy is. When designing an
                                          encounter, depending on the wanted difficulty level, the encounter can be a
                                          given a maximum enemy-weight. Then, by looking at the threat level as an
                                          indicator for enemy-weight, the encounter can then be filled with enemies
                                          until the maximum threat level is reached. Threat level can also be seen as a
                                          rough indicator for raw stats and numbers like health, ability power and
                                          damage of an enemy. Enemies with high threat levels usually have higher raw
                                          stats than lower threat level enemies. Threat level is a scale, enemies can be
                                          inbetween the given threat levels of low, medium and high.

                                    It is important to keep in mind that enemies can work at all kinds of different
                                    ranges, regardless of their behaviour and goal. Often when designing enemies, there
                                    is a trap to fall into, designing the same enemies over and over again. Tank-type
                                    enemies often will be close range and sniper enemies will always be long range, but
                                    they don't have to be.
